# Welcome To My Site  
![Profile Pic](@alias_Home/ProtfolioProfilePic.jpg "A head shot of me.")

 Hello & welcome, I'm Derek Fields.
 I'm an educator & an Web Developer, but that just what I mainly do for money currently. Some of the things I like to do out side of work stuff is bicycling through my city, meeting new cool people at events and meetups messing with electronics & MCUs, playing video games and watching anime. This site, 'DerekFields.is', as you can guess, is used to give the web an idea of who I am as person & not just a software developer. It's a bit bare at the moment. I will add more style and pages to DerekFields.is in time.
